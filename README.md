# C# Project A – OpenWeather

This repository contains my solution for **Project A** in the ADOP C# course.  
The goal of the project is to build a C# console application that retrieves weather forecast data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, handles JSON data, and uses asynchronous programming features in .NET.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Fetch live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API
- Parse and deserialize JSON using C#
- Use `async` / `await` for non-blocking calls
- Implement events for status notifications
- Apply LINQ for filtering and grouping data
- Show weather results in the console
- Add caching to avoid repeated API calls
